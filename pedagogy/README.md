###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
This experiment contains Wien bridge oscillator simulator using an op-amp. Firstly, student will make proper connections to complete the circuit of the Wien bridge oscillator using an operational amplifier. If the circuit is properly connected then the student will observe a sine wave at the output of Wien bridge oscillator. Students will also check the effect of variation of resistance on the output waveform.<br>
