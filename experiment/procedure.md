1) Connect the output terminals to the cro.(L1-L2,L3-L4)<br/>
2) Click on the "check" button to check if the connections are right.<br/>
3) Once you make sure that the connections are right, you may vary the resistance and calculate the output frequency <br/>
4) Increase the resistance from 0.3K&ohm; to 300K&ohm;. <br/>
5) Click on "Add to table" button to add the reading to the table.<br/>
6) Observe the waveform in the graph.<br/>
